 <t id="1001">Greetings, pilot. Are you here about the job?</t>
 <t id="1002">An individual, calling themselves Santa Claus, is giving away toys! This is cutting into our profits and must be dealt with.</t>
 <t id="1003">We need you to handle this problem by taking out this Santa Claus. We have received reports of several bodyguards but nothing you shouldn't be able to handle.</t>
 <t id="1004">Wonderful! This will be a most profitable endeavor.</t>
 <t id="1005">That's a pity, let us know if you change your mind.</t>
 <t id="1006">We await the results of your mission.</t>
 <t id="1007">Grinch</t>
 <t id="1008">Santa Claus is giving away toys for free! The profits of many Teladi are being hurt, so the issue must be dealt with. Find Santa Claus and end this madness.</t>
